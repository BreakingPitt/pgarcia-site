# Whoami_

Hello, my name is P. Garcia, I'm in middle of my forties and although originally from [Vigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigo) now I live in [Móstoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3stoles), with my wife Cristina, my daughter Vega and my two dogs, called Kox and Iris.

I’ve been in tech for my entire career in one form or another, my expertise spans across AWS, GCP and Azure, I have played a key role as a Cloud Engineer in helping companies transition from on-premise and traditional solutions to cloud-based systems, empowering them with enhanced agility and efficiency managing their infrastructure.

In addition to my cloud expertise, I have a strong background in DevOps practices, which has allowed me to significantly improve delivery speed and quality through automation and streamlined processes.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar and spending time with my family, including my wife and my daughters in Móstoles. I’m an avid sports fan, especially when it comes to Formula 1, NBA, NFL, and NHL. I also train and play basketball in the small forward position, always striving to improve my skills, both on and off the court.
